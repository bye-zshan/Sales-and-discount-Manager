"# Sales-and-discount-Manager" 
I created this while i was learning PY .
Concepts (OOPS Principle, CSV file use) .
It consists of 3 files ; item.py,phone.py,main.py .
All clases and the functions are defined in the item.py & phone.py and the main.py file used to manage/control all the process to give output .
